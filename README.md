# go-mvc-template
A starter MVC template for GO.
As GO is, happily, a very light beginner friendly language, it's starter install
has not much if you are planning to go for a MVC GRUD type of application.

This is a startup project that can be used to expand from it.

The mods installed are:
- Fiber V2
- Fiber HTML V2
- Gorm
- godotenv
